## Overview

### **The Goal**

I set out to create a redesign of [GitHub Jobs](https://jobs.github.com/), a job board created by GitHub. I built the React application that's layered on top the API, the GitHub Jobs API belongs to GitHub, and the front-end design was created by Frontend Mentors.

### **Requirements**

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- View all jobs currently live on the GitHub Jobs API
- Be able to click a job from the index page so that they can read more information and apply for the job
- Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences (light or dark mode)

### **Links**

- Live Site URL: TBD

## My Process

### **Built With**

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Styled System](https://styled-system.com/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)

### **Useful Resources**

- [Styled Components + Styled System = Super Power by Shiva Pandey](https://shivapandey.com/react/styled-components-styled-system-1/) - This three-part blog post provides a concise explanation on how styled system and styled components work together, which was something I struggled with at first.
- [A Dark Mode Toggle with React and ThemeProvider](https://css-tricks.com/a-dark-mode-toggle-with-react-and-themeprovider/) - An example of how to implement dark mode through styled component theming.
